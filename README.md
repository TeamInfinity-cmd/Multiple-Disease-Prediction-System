This repository contains a Multiple Disease Prediction System that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient data. The project aims to assist in early diagnosis of diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkingson's Disease using patient health parameters.

Features
Predicts the risk of multiple diseases from medical input data (age, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.).
Implements and compares multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Easy-to-use interface for entering patient data and viewing prediction results.
Supports scalability to include more diseases by adding new models and datasets.
Tech Stack
Python for model development.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Streamlit for Deployment of the ML model.
